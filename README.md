# Search History Randomizer
<br>
Lets say you accidentally clicked an embarrasing link, and you cannot delete it. This is where the Search History Randomizer comes in. It will open random normal sites so that your search history looks more normal.

## Disclaimer (please read)
Do not use this for malicious, illegal, or harmful purposes. This is only meant to make your search history look normal if you can't delete search history

## System Requirements
<br>
There isn't much. It's just to be able to open links, have a search history, and have a browser.
